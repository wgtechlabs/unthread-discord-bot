# Unthread → Discord File Attachment Flow Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the file attachment flow from Unthread to Discord, allowing agents to send files that are automatically forwarded to Discord users in their support threads.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The implementation follows the existing webhook-based pattern in the bot with minimal changes to the core message handling logic:

```
Unthread Agent → Unthread API → Webhook → Discord Bot → Discord Thread
     |                                        |
     └── Sends message with attachments      └── Downloads & uploads files
```

## 📂 Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- **`src/services/attachmentHandler.ts`** - Core attachment processing logic

### Modified Files  
- **`src/services/unthread.ts`** - Enhanced `handleMessageCreated` function
- **`.gitignore`** - Added test file exclusions

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. AttachmentHandler Service

The `AttachmentHandler` class provides the core functionality:

```typescript
// Download files from Unthread URLs
downloadFileToBuffer(url: string): Promise<FileAttachment>

// Process multiple attachments concurrently
downloadAttachments(attachments: MessageAttachment[]): Promise<FileAttachment[]>

// Convert to Discord-compatible format
createDiscordAttachments(files: FileAttachment[]): AttachmentBuilder[]

// Main processing entry point
AttachmentHandler.processAttachments(attachments): Promise<AttachmentBuilder[]>
```

### 2. Memory-Efficient Processing

- Uses `fetch()` API with streaming for file downloads
- Buffer-based processing (no temporary files)
- Concurrent downloads with individual error handling
- File size validation (25MB Discord limit)
- Timeout handling (30 seconds per file)

### 3. Enhanced Message Validation

Modified the webhook message validation in `handleMessageCreated`:

```typescript
// Before: Required text content
if (!conversationId || !messageText) {
    return;
}

// After: Allow messages with attachments but no text
if (!conversationId || (!messageText && !AttachmentHandler.hasValidAttachments(attachments))) {
    return;
}
```

### 4. Discord Integration

The implementation seamlessly integrates with Discord's messaging system:

```typescript
const messageOptions = {};
if (hasText) messageOptions.content = messageContent;
if (hasAttachments) messageOptions.files = discordAttachments;

// Fallback message for attachment-only messages
if (!hasText && hasAttachments) {
    messageOptions.content = `📎 ${discordAttachments.length} file(s) shared`;
}

await discordThread.send(messageOptions);
```

## 🎯 Supported Features

### File Types
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- **Documents**: PDF, Plain text
- **Media**: MP4, WebM, MP3, WAV, OGG

### Error Handling
- Individual file download failures don't block other files
- Graceful fallback to text-only messages if all attachments fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Network timeout handling
- File size validation

### Performance
- Concurrent file downloads for multiple attachments
- Memory-efficient buffer processing
- No temporary file creation
- Proper resource cleanup with AbortController

## 🔄 Message Flow

1. **Webhook Reception**: Unthread sends `message_created` webhook
2. **Validation**: Check for valid conversation ID and content/attachments
3. **Thread Lookup**: Find corresponding Discord thread
4. **Attachment Processing**: 
   - Download files from Unthread URLs
   - Convert to Discord AttachmentBuilder format
   - Handle any download failures gracefully
5. **Message Sending**: Send to Discord with text and/or attachments
6. **Logging**: Record success/failure details

## 🛡️ Security & Validation

- File size limits enforced (25MB Discord maximum)
- Content-type validation
- Secure URL downloading with timeout protection
- No execution of downloaded content
- Proper error boundaries to prevent service disruption

## 📊 Testing

Core functionality verified through:
- Unit tests for attachment validation logic
- Message structure handling validation
- Error condition testing
- Method existence verification

The implementation maintains backward compatibility and gracefully handles edge cases like:
- Messages with only attachments (no text)
- Mixed text and attachment messages
- Attachment download failures
- Network timeouts
- Invalid file types

## 🚀 Usage

The feature is automatically enabled for all webhook events. When Unthread agents send messages with file attachments, they will be:

1. Downloaded from Unthread's storage
2. Uploaded to the corresponding Discord thread
3. Displayed with appropriate fallback text if needed

No additional configuration is required beyond the existing webhook setup.
