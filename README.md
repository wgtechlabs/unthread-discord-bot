yarn deploycommand:dev
```

### How to Get Your Discord Server ID

1. Open Discord and go to your server.
2. Click on the server name at the top of the channel list to open the dropdown menu.
3. Select "Server Settings".
4. In the "Server Settings" menu, go to the "Widget" tab.
5. Enable the "Server Widget" option if it is not already enabled.
6. The "Server ID" will be displayed under the "Widget" settings.

Alternatively, you can enable Developer Mode to get the server ID:

1. Go to your Discord user settings.
2. Navigate to the "Advanced" tab under "App Settings".
3. Enable "Developer Mode".
4. Right-click on your server name in the server list.
5. Select "Copy ID" to copy the server ID to your clipboard.

## üåê Webhook Configuration (Development)

For local development, you'll need to expose your webhook endpoint to receive events from Unthread:

### Option 1: Using VS Code Port Forwarding (Recommended)

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
3. Type `Ports: Focus on Ports View` and select it.
4. In the Ports view, click on the `+` icon to add a new port.
5. Enter `3000` (or your configured PORT) as the port number and press Enter.
6. Click on the globe icon next to the port to make it publicly accessible.
7. Copy the generated public URL for use in the Unthread webhook configuration.

### Option 2: Using ngrok (Alternative)

1. Install ngrok: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Run ngrok to expose your local port:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. Copy the generated HTTPS URL for use in the Unthread webhook configuration.

### Configure Webhook in Unthread Dashboard

1. Log in to your Unthread dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Settings" or "Integrations" section.
3. Under "Webhook Configuration", enter the following URL: `https://<YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>/webhook/unthread`
   - Replace `<YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>` with the public URL from your port forwarding setup
   - For production: Use your actual server domain (e.g., `https://your-bot-server.com/webhook/unthread`)
4. Configure the webhook to send events to the unthread-webhook-server, which will queue them for the bot.
5. Save the settings.

**Note:** The Discord bot now receives events through a Redis queue from the unthread-webhook-server, similar to the Telegram bot architecture. Direct webhook signature validation has been removed.

### Configure Forum Channels (Optional)

To enable automatic ticket creation from forum posts:

1. Add forum channel IDs to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   FORUM_CHANNEL_IDS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789
   ```

   - Replace the IDs with the actual IDs of your forum channels.
   - You can find the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel name in Discord and selecting "Copy ID" (make sure Developer Mode is enabled in your Discord settings).

2. Each comma-separated ID represents a forum channel that will be monitored for new posts.
3. Any new forum posts in these channels will automatically create a corresponding ticket in Unthread.
4. Replies in the forum post will be synchronized with the Unthread ticket.
5. The bot includes validation to ensure only actual forum channels are processed, preventing conflicts with text channels.

> **Important**: Only add actual forum channel IDs to this list. The bot will validate channel types to prevent issues.
