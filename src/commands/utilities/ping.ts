/**
 * Ping Command - Bot Latency Diagnostics
 * 
 * @description 
 * Diagnostic slash command providing real-time connection metrics between the bot
 * and Discord services. Measures API response times and WebSocket heartbeat for
 * troubleshooting connectivity and performance issues.
 * 
 * @module commands/utilities/ping
 * @since 1.0.0
 * 
 * @keyFunctions
 * - execute(): Measures and displays API latency and WebSocket heartbeat metrics
 * 
 * @commonIssues
 * - High API latency: Network congestion or Discord API slowdowns (API >1000ms)
 * - WebSocket heartbeat problems: Gateway connection issues (WS >200ms or N/A)
 * - Timeout errors: Command takes too long to respond due to network issues
 * - Permission errors: Bot lacks permission to respond in channel
 * - Rate limiting: Command used too frequently causing throttling
 * 
 * @troubleshooting
 * - API latency >500ms: Check network connectivity and Discord API status
 * - WebSocket "N/A": Bot gateway connection failed, restart may be needed
 * - Command timeouts: Verify bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission
 * - High latencies consistently: Consider server location relative to Discord
 * - Rate limit errors: Implement cooldowns for diagnostic commands
 * 
 * @performance
 * - Uses deferReply() for accurate latency measurement without timeout
 * - Lightweight operation with minimal resource usage
 * - Real-time metrics reflect current connection quality
 * - Embedded response for improved user experience
 * 
 * @dependencies Discord.js SlashCommandBuilder, EmbedBuilder, ChatInputCommandInteraction
 * 
 * @example Basic Usage
 * ```typescript
 * // Slash command: /ping
 * // Response: Displays API latency and WebSocket heartbeat in embed
 * ```
 * 
 * @example Advanced Usage
 * ```typescript
 * // Monitor for performance issues
 * if (apiLatency > 1000) {
 *   LogEngine.warn(`High API latency detected: ${apiLatency}ms`);
 * }
 * ```

 * Executes ping command and measures bot performance metrics
 *
 * @async
 * @function execute

 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves after sending latency metrics embed
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Called automatically by Discord.js when /ping command is used
 * // Measures API round-trip time and WebSocket heartbeat
 * ```
 * 
 * @troubleshooting
 * - Defer reply prevents interaction timeout during measurement
 * - API latency calculated from interaction timing difference
 * - WebSocket ping retrieved from client.ws.ping property
 * - N/A displayed when WebSocket connection unavailable
